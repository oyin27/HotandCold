    <p>Welcome to Hot and Cold!</p>
    <p>Here are the rules:</p>
    <p>- You will have 5 guesses to guess the chosen number.</p>
    <p>- Each round, you start at 50.</p>
    <p>- You will have the options to add and/or subtract 1, 5, 10, and 25 from your most recent guess.</p5>
    <p>- If you're more than 55 away, you are Very Cold.</p>
    <p>- If you're within 41-55, you are Cold.</p>
    <p>- If you're within 31-40, you are Very Cool.</p>
    <p>- If you're within 21-30, you are Cool.</p>
    <p>- If you're within 16-20, you are Warm.</p>
    <p>- If you're within 9-15, you are Very Warm.</p>
    <p>- If you're within 6-8, you are Hot.</p>
    <p>- And if you're within 5, you are Very Hot.</p>
    <p>If you are Very Hot, the number of your remaining guesses does not decrease.</p>
    <p>You can not go below 1, nor can you surpass 100.</p>
    <p>Once you've surpassed your number of guesses, you have lost.</p>
    <p>And if you are able to guess the number, you've won!</p>
